Walkthrough
========================

So you finished installing Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab, and you verified that everything is working as expected...

Now what?

The following walkthrough will guide you through setting up an Isaac Lab extension project, adding a new robot to lab, designing an environment, and training a policy for that robot. 
For this walkthrough, we will be starting with the Jetbot, a simple two wheeled differential base robot with a camera mounted on top, but the intent is for these guides to be general enough that you can use them to add your own robots and environments to Isaac Lab!
